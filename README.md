## How to start ?

 this is a repo -> BTIOSS/BTIOSS.github.io   
( all github projects are stored in a repositories they are like the root folder for a project uploaded on github )

1. Fork this repo   
   click on the fork button on the top right of the page (click on star also, thanks :D)
   a fork is a copy that is stored on your account, so _BTIOSS/abc_ becomes _abhishah16/abc_

2. Clone your repo 
  
   create a folder on your desktop(/anywhere :P)    
   name it devWork/openSourceWork(/anything :P)   
   open your CMD or Terminal and go inside your folder   
   then type `git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/BTIOSS.github.io.git`   
   eg. if I am abhishah16 then  `git clone https://github.com/abhishah16/BTIOSS.github.io.git`
